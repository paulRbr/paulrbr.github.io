There has been a little while I wanted to create this mini-blog. I guess the [panic monster](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en) finally came to say hello. So here it is I am happy to launch this site today! \o/!

The goal is mostly to keep track of problems that I solved and want to keep for later. If I need them at least twice I guess it means it can help other people.

Opinions here are my own and not related to any of the companies I work or have worked for. Hope you will like it!
