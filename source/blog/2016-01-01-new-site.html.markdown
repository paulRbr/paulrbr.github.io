There has been a little while I wanted to create this mini-blog. I guess the [panic monster](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en) came to say hello so I am happy to launch this site today! \o/!

I will try to reference here some of my discoveries through my personal and professional IT projects. Mostly around software, automation, site reliability and distributed systems;

Opinions here are my own and not related to any of the companies I work or have worked for.
